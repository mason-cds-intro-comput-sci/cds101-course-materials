### What you need to do

This GitHub repository contains a starter file called `rmarkdown_practice.Rmd`. Your job is to edit the contents of this file in RStudio so that when you Knit it to a PDF, it exactly matches the contents and formatting of this example file: [`minihw01_rmarkdown_practice_final_output.pdf`][rmarkdown-recreate-pdf]. 

Useful tips:

* The `rmarkdown_practice.Rmd` template file is divided into two sections. 
  * The top of the file contains metadata and formatting instructions. These are provided to you, but you may need to edit their contents to get the correct formatting. 
  * Below that is a section where you will need to enter the main text of the document.
* At the top of the document, make sure that you've replaced [FirstName LastName]{.monospace} with your name.
* Also, the date at the top of your knitted document will, by default, display the current date. This is okay and you do not need to change it to match the sample document.
* Use your knowledge from the readings combined with the [`RMarkdown cheatsheet`][rmarkdown-cheatsheet] to format the RMarkdown file correctly.

When you're ready to submit, follow the directions in the **[How to submit](#how-to-submit)** section below.

**Note**

Alternatively, [`minihw01_rmarkdown_practice_final_output.html`][rmarkdown-recreate-html] is what you should get if you knit to HTML instead of PDF.
You may find it helpful to compare your knitted HTML with this to make sure you're on the right track.

## How to submit

To submit your assignment, follow the two steps below.
Your homework will be graded for credit **after** you've completed both steps!

1.  Save, commit, and push your completed R Markdown file so that everything is synchronized to GitHub.
    If you do this right, then you will be able to view your completed file on the GitHub website.

2.  Knit your R Markdown document to the PDF format, export (download) the PDF file from RStudio Server, and then upload it to *Mini-homework 1* posting on Blackboard.
