# Mini-homework 2: Visualization practice

## Instructions

This assignment will show you how to combine regular Markdown and R code in a single RMarkdown document. First, import the project into RStudio using *New Project > Version Control > Git* as usual, and copying the URL of this GitHub repository.

You will be editing the starter template file called `visualization_practice.Rmd`. Open this file in RStudio and take a look at the contents.

Note the sections of R code scattered among the document. In an RMarkdown document, R code has to occur between triple-backticks:

    ```
    Some R code here
    ```

In the top right corner of these R code sections, you will see a little green arrow (in RStudio). Click this to run the code in those sections of the file.

The `visualization_practice.Rmd` file contains a series of exercises for you to complete. Work through these exercises (running the code blocks as you go), and write your answers in the indicated spaces within the file.

When you're ready to submit, follow the directions in the **[How to submit](#how-to-submit)** section below.

## How to submit

To submit your assignment, follow the two steps below.
Your homework will be graded for credit **after** you've completed both steps!

1.  Save, commit, and push your completed R Markdown file so that everything is synchronized to GitHub.
    If you do this right, then you will be able to view your completed file on the GitHub website.

2.  Knit your R Markdown document to the PDF format, export (download) the PDF file from RStudio Server, and then upload it to *Mini-homework 2* posting on Blackboard.
